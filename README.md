# Pizza Parlor

## by _**John Whitten**_

### _December 11, 2021_

#### _This is a web-based application wherein the user can order a pizza, select various toppings and sizes, and receive an order confirmation._

## Technologies Used

- _HTML_
- _CSS_
- _Bootstrap_
- _Javascript_
- _jQuery-3.6.0_

## Project Title: Pizza Parlor

## Description

_{This is the fourth independent project for Epicodus.}_

_{Project Prompt: Create a website for a pizza company where a user can choose one or more individual toppings (cheese, pepperoni, artichoke, anchovy, etc) and a size to order a pizza and see the final cost.}_

_{• Allow the user to choose toppings and size for the pizza they'd like to order.}_
_{• Create a pizza object constructor with properties for toppings and size.}_
_{• Create a prototype method for the cost of a pizza depending on the selections chosen. Use your own formula for this. Keep it simple to start! You do not need to have a complex formula for determining cost (although you can if you like). The most important part of this code review is using and demonstrating your understanding of constructors and prototypes.}_


## Project Objectives

_{• Constructors and prototypes are used successfully.}_

_{• Application works as expected.}_

_{• Tests are included for each business logic behavior and code is committed after each test passes.}_

_{• Project is in a polished, portfolio-quality state and follows best practices and coding conventions taught at Epicodus.}_

_{• The prompt’s required functionality and baseline project requirements are in place by the deadline.}_

### Project Objectives Further Exploration

_{• Site is styled with CSS and images.}_

_{• Allow users to order more than one pizza with different toppings.}_

_{• Display the list of pizzas ordered as links that can be clicked for details.}_

_{• Offer a delivery option that then requires address information.}_


## Directions

_{• Open the terminal on your local computer.}_

_{• Navigate to the parent directory of your preference.}_

_{• Clone this project using $ git clone https://github.com/johnwhittenstudio/project-4}_


Contents include the following html page:

- index.html

The html web form does not need a server to run and can be completed and interacted with by clicking on the "click here" button.

This html web form works on Chrome, Firefox, and Safari.

There are 5 categories in this form:

1. "What is your name?"
2. "What is your age?"
3. "Which animal is the best?"
4. "Which activity brings you the most comfort?"
5. "What is your favorite color?"

After completing the form, the user needs to click on the "click here" button to be taken to the programming language branch. Depending on which selection the user makes in category #3 and category #4, they will be taken to one of 3 different branches.

This html web form site contains 3 branches:

1. "Python"
2. "C#"
3. "Rust"

Each branch gives the user an introduction to that specific programming language and contains a hyperlink to the wikipedi page on that language.

Text entered into the "What is your name?" category will appear at the top of each branch returned.

Clicking on the "click here" button at the bottom of the programming language branch will redirect the user back to the form, where they can enter different selections.
